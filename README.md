## Post-Mortem
    TODO

## Analytics
![Points over time analytic](Annotation0.png)
Jan 23 our landscapers would only build a 3 by 3 wall, also known as the turtle. It was the standard that everyone was doing because it worked. We left this strategy in favor of raising the land around the HQ and then building the turtle later on. We could then build a multi-layered turtle to beat other turtles, however we did not have enough time to implement this before 6pm, Jan 27.


## Best Case Scenario

*Notice the beautifully flat and even terrain
Our 3 by 3 turtle forms once the HQ-pad is complete, then drones clump together, stopping any enemies from getting in as long as they block all entrances.

## Every Other Case Scenario
![Failure gif](Failure.gif)
The landscapers would try to raise the land too high instead of just trying to get everything above water level, which took too long. The problem was that in best case scenarios, the landscapers would have nothing to do.
